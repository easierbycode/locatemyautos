current:
 - assets:precompile automatically on 'new instance'
   - use deploy/before_migrate.rb?
   - does shared/assets need to be created?
   - does symlink of public/assets -> shared/assets need to happen AFTER precompile?

future:
 - how do I restart unicorn?
   - might be:
     - sudo /srv/www/lma/shared/scripts/unicorn clean-restart
